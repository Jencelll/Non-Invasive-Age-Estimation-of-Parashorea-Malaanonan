This project focuses on the **non-invasive estimation of tree age** for *Parashorea malaanonan* (locally known as **Bagtikan**), a dipterocarp species native to the Philippines.  
Using **machine learning techniques**, the system predicts tree age based on measurable attributes such as **Diameter at Breast Height (DBH)**, avoiding destructive sampling methods.


## 📌 Project Objectives

- Develop a **machine learning-based age estimation model** for *Parashorea malaanonan*
- Utilize **non-invasive tree measurements** (e.g., DBH)
- Provide an interpretable and reproducible workflow for forestry and environmental research
- Support sustainable forest management and conservation efforts
