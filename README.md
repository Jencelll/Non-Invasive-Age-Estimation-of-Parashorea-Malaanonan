# 🌳 Non-Invasive Age Estimation of *Parashorea malaanonan* Using Machine Learning

This project focuses on the **non-invasive estimation of tree age** for *Parashorea malaanonan* (locally known as **Bagtikan**), a dipterocarp species native to the Philippines.  
Using **machine learning techniques**, the system predicts tree age based on measurable attributes such as **Diameter at Breast Height (DBH)**, avoiding destructive sampling methods.
